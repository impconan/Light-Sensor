# Light Intensity Control using ATMEGA32

🔆💡🔌

This project utilizes the ATMEGA32 microcontroller along with an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), a potentiometer, and 8 LEDs to control the light intensity. The principle of the voltage divider is employed by keeping the resistance of the potentiometer constant and varying the output voltage by changing the resistance of the LDR based on changes in light intensity. As the light intensity decreases, the number of LEDs illuminated increases.

## Features

✨🌟

- Control the light intensity using an LDR and a potentiometer
- Vary the output voltage using the voltage divider principle
- Illuminate a different number of LEDs based on the light intensity
- Adjustable sensitivity using the potentiometer
